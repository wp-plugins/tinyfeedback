A minimalistic yet highly configurable feedback plugin. Options to intergrate with Google Analytics and Akismet available.

== Description ==

tinyFeedback help you collect feedback in a manner that in unobtrusive and flexible for your visitors, while still having many powerful, configurable features.

When activated on your website, a tab is inserted with a short message and two options, positive and negative. When the user selects either option, the counter value for the corresponding page is increased. If the negative option is selected, a lightbox form appears querying the visitor for more information.

Optionally, a cookie can be set so that the visitor will not see the same request again after leaving feedback.

All texts displayed can be configured through the administration panel, and there are several visual appearances (styles) to choose from.

In addition to the above, tinyFeedback offers functionality to bind the activity to Google Analytics event tracking, and filter the form input through Akismet to avoid spam. For the advanced user, the CSS- and jQuery-injection can be disabled and performed manually instead, for optimization purposes.
